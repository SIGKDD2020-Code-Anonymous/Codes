# Codes
This repository contains the codes that generated the simulation results (illustrated in Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 in the Section 4) of the paper titled "Estimating Power-law Degree Distributions via Friendship Paradox based Sampling" which was submitted to the SIGKDD 2020 conference. The codes are made available to facilitate the full reproducibility of the simulation results included in the paper and to assist the readers to clarify any additional questions they may have about the simulation setup and results included in the paper. 

### Instructions
 The codes were written in Python (version 3.7.3). The files "Fig2Code.py", "Fig3Code.py", "Fig4Code.py" generate the Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 in Section 4 of the paper, respectively.
