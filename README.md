# Codes
This repository contains the codes that generated the numerical results (in Section 4) of the paper titled "Estimating Power-law Degree Distributions via Friendship Paradox based Sampling". The codes are made available to facilitate the full reproducibility of the simulation results included in the paper and to assist the readers to clarify any additional questions they may have about the simulation setup and results included in the paper. A detailed discussion of the steps followed in each code is also available in the Reproducibiliy Appendix of the paper (pg. 10).

### Instructions
The codes were implemented and results were generated in Python - version 3.7.3. 

The files "Fig2Code.py", "Fig3Code.py", "Fig4Code.py" generate Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 (in Section 4 of the paper) respectively, and save them as PDF files in the working directory.
