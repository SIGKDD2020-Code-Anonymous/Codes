## Simulation Codes: "Estimating Power-law Degree Distributions via Friendship Paradox based Sampling"

### Documentation
This repository contains all the codes that generated the numerical results (in Section 4) of the paper titled "Estimating Power-law Degree Distributions via Friendship Paradox based Sampling". A detailed discussion of the steps followed in each code is also available in the Reproducibiliy Appendix (pg. 10) of the paper.

### Directions
The codes were implemented and results were generated in Python - version 3.7.3. 

Run the files "Fig2Code.py", "Fig3Code.py" and "Fig4Code.py" to generate Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 (in Section 4 of the paper) respectively. The generated figures are saved as PDF files in the working directory.
